# Conways Game of Life in Python 3

The Game of Life, also known just as *Life* is a celullar automaton. Based on simple rules, cell can live, die or revive neighbors.

## Rules

Cells of *Life* are elements of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and their *neighbors* are its eight adjacent points, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Every cell can be either *alive* or *dead*. At each step in time, the state of a cell can change by the following rules:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The generation 0 is known as the *seed* of the system, and each new generation is generated by applying these rules to the previous generation. As new generations arise, different types of patterns may present. If you are intereseted, further information can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python3
- Tkinter

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/conways-game-of-life.git
```
2. Grant run permission to 'run.sh':
```
chmod +x run.sh
```
3. Execute 'run.sh' to start:
```
./run.sh
```

### Controls:
- Right click to toggle a cell in the grid
- Left click drag to pan
- Mouse wheel to zoom
- Double left click to start simulation
- Ctrl + ceft click to restart simulation
- Shift + left click to pause simulation

**Warning:** Tkinter window will not close if the simmulation is running.
